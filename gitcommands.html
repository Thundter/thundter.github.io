	<h1>Git Commands</h1>
	<a href="index.html" >Index</a>
	<h2>Creating a new repository</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Create on Git and then clone locally</li>
		<li>Initialize repository locally and then add a remote repository. To do this navigate to where the repository will be located. In git cmd, type 
		<blockquote cite="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init">git init</blockquote></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Remote Repositories (aka Remotes) </h2>
	<p>Remotes are where pushes and pulls are sourced from. Local repository can reference multiple remote repositories. "origin" is standard for the primary repository</p>
	<blockquote cite="">git remote add [remote_name] [URL]</blockquote> ...then push with... <blockquote cite="">git push [remote_name] [branch]</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>The Staging area</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Before commiting updates add them to the staging area <blockquote cite="">git add</blockquote></li>
		<li>To add everthing new, changed and deleted<blockquote cite="">git add --all</blockquote></li>
		<li>To add all files in a path <blockquote cite="">git add [path]/</blockquote></li>
		<li>To unstage files <blockquote cite="">git reset [file]</blockquote></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Undoing local changes</h2>
	<p>To revert changes, "checkout" the file. This will overwrite local changes with the latest committed version of the file in your local repository.</p>
	<blockquote cite="">git checkout -- [file]</blockquote>

	<h2>Commiting</h2>
	<p>Files are not automatically sent to yout remote repository. They are first 'staged' so that groups of files can be commited together</p>
	<p>comment every commit!</p>
	<blockquote cite="">git commit -m '[commit message]'</blockquote>

	<h2>Undoing a commit</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To undo a commit, leaving everything else intact<blockquote cite="">git reset --soft HEAD^</blockquote></li>
		<li>To undo a commit and everything staged, but leave the work tree<blockquote cite="">git reset HEAD^</blockquote></li>
		<li>To completely throw away all uncommitted changes, resetting everything to the previous commit<blockquote cite="">git reset --hard HEAD^</blockquote>This will leave un-tracked files though, to remove these call <blockquote cite="">git clean -d -f</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The HEAD^ denotes the commit before the current HEAD version.</p>
	
	<h2>Pushing</h2>
	<p>Refers to pushing local commits to a remotes</p>
	<p>If the remote is ahead by 1 or more commits it won't allow a push. The remote commits need to be pulled and merged first</p>
	<blockquote cite="">git push [remote_name] [branch_name]</blockquote> example 1 <blockquote cite="">git push origin master</blockquote> example 2 <blockquote cite="">git push bitbucket dev</blockquote>

	<h2>Pulling/Merging</h2>
	<p>Pulling gets remote commits and merges them into your local branch. You can use pull to merge branches back into master. E.g. if you have a branch called hotfix1 on the remote origin you can merge this back into master with... <blockquote cite="">git pull origin hotfix1</blockquote></p>
	The same as calling <blockquote cite="">git fetch</blockquote> and <blockquote cite="">git merge hotfix1</blockquote>

	<h2>Branching</h2>
	<p>You create new branches locally<blockquote cite="">git branch feature1</blockquote> and <blockquote cite="">git checkout feature1</blockquote></p>
	Or you can just create and checkout with <blockquote cite="">git checkout -b feature1</blockquote>
		When working in a branch make sure you push the branch using <blockquote cite="">git push [remote_name] [branch_name]</blockquote>

	<p>Your branch won't be available from the remote until you push it!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To delete a local branch you can call <blockquote cite="">git branch -d [branch_name]</blockquote></li>
		<li>To delete a branch from remote call <blockquote cite="">git push [remote_name] --delete [branch_name]</blockquote> e.g. <blockquote cite="">git push origin --delete hotfix1</blockquote></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Tagging</h2>
	<p>Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.
	A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn&#39;t change. It&#39;s just a pointer to a specific commit</p>
	<p>Annotated tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. They contain the tagger name, email, and date and have a tagging message (we should use these the majority of the time)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To create an annotated tag call <blockquote cite="">git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"</blockquote></li>
		<li>You can view a list of tags with <blockquote cite="">git tag</blockquote></li>
	</ul>	

	<h2>Stashing</h2>
	<p>To keep something that is not ready for commit you can "stash" local changes</p>
	<p>When you are ready, you can re-apply the stash against the branch</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To stash all your uncommitted changes just run <blockquote cite="">git stash</blockquote></li>
		<li>And then to re-apply them against your working copy run <blockquote cite="">git stash apply</blockquote></li>
	</ul>

	<p>You can have multiple stash stacks and pick which one you want to apply</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p><b>Conflicts:</b> if two people have commited changes to the same lines of the same file you will get a conflict. Easiest approach to resolve this is to use a merge tool</p>
	<p><b>Detached head:</b> When you checkout a specific commit you are detached from the HEAD which is a pointer to the latest commit in the branch. You just need to checkout the branch again to fix this.</p>
